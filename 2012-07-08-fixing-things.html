		<h1>Fixing things</h1>

		<p>You already know that <a href="/2012-07-08-this-site-isnt-perfect.html">this site isn’t perfect</a>. That’s not an excuse, just a fact. As I notice things that are necessary but missing or things that don’t work well, I’ll be updating them.</p>

		<p>The first thing I noticed when I pulled the site up on my iPhone was that it didn’t look good at all. This is what the table of contents looked like:</p>

		<img class="iphone-screenshot" src="/images/posts/fixing-things/breaking-things-mobile-1-cropped.png">

		<p>And this was the first post:</p>

		<img class="iphone-screenshot" src="/images/posts/fixing-things/breaking-things-mobile-2-cropped.png">

		<p>Not very readable.</p>

		<p>So I took about fifteen minutes to add a few lines of code to make the site easier to read on smaller screens. First off, I added the <code>viewport</code> meta-tag to get a quick win:</p>

		<pre><code data-language="html">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</code></pre>

		<p>Secondly, on screens with widths less than 600 pixels, I wanted to make the font size smaller since the text was appearing way too large. As I set my font size to 1px in the <code>html</code> element and use <code>rems</code> everywhere, I was able to do this easily and also maintain the rhythm of the margins, etc., with just a single media query:</p>

		<pre><code data-language="css">@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  html {
    font-size: 0.8px;
  }
}</code></pre>
		<p>Finally<a id="footnote-origin" href="#footnote"><sup>*</sup></a>, I saw that the orange accent on the left margin which I’m creating with a CSS gradient applied as the background image to the <code>html</code> element was blurry on my retina display so I added a media query to set the background size on that which fixed the problem.</p>

		<p>And here are the after shots, starting with the table of contents:</p>

		<img class="fullsize-iphone-screenshot" src="/images/posts/fixing-things/after-1-cropped.png">

		<p>And that first article, again:</p>

		<img class="fullsize-iphone-screenshot" src="/images/posts/fixing-things/after-2-cropped.png">

		<p>That’s a bit more like it. At least you lovely folks won’t be straining your eyes to read my chronicles on your mobile phones.</p>

		<p>My personal reboot isn’t about the development details of this site, but this site is part of my personal reboot so I might&#8202;—&#8202;from time to time&#8202;—&#8202;talk about it in passing with posts like this one.</p>

		<p id="footnote">* While writing this post I had to display some code, so I prettified it using the <a href="http://craig.is/making/rainbows/">rainbow.js</a> syntax highlighting library. Also, in keeping with the spirit of <strong>the simplest thing that could possibly work</strong>, I added local styles to the post to deal with the screenshots, which are taken on a Retina display iPhone and displayed at half their original size so they’ll look good on high-resolution displays. <a href="#footnote-origin">↩</a></p>
