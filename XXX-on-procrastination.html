		<h1>On procrastination</h1>

		<blockquote><dfn>Procrastination</dfn>: the act of replacing high-priority actions with tasks of lower priority, or doing something from which one derives enjoyment, and thus putting off important tasks to a later time.&#8202;—&#8202;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination" title="Procrastination - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>

		<p>I’ll let you in on a dirty little personal secret: I’ve been procrastinating the organisation of my personal space for years now.</p>

		<h2>Breaking routine</h2>

		The problem:

		<h2>Reducing distractions</h2>

		<div class="case-study">
			<h3>Symptom</h3>

			<p>I wake up to the alarm on my phone. As I turn off the alarm, I notice that there are notifications from social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram, etc., and I get sucked into the whirlpool of infinite scroll for hours on end while still in bed.</p>

			<h3>Prognosis</h3>

			<p>My smartphone is a major distraction and not getting a proper start to the day was greatly limiting my productivity and morale.</p>

			<h3>Prescription</h3>

			<p>Separate your time‐keeping device from your social‐network device.</p>

			<h3>Result</h3>

			<a href="2012-07-09-i-just-bought-a-watch.html">I bought a watch</a> and started leaving my phone downstairs to charge. I get up when the alarm on my watch goes and I have to get up and go downstairs for my shower. I get up immediately now instead of lazing for ages in bed and I’ve started to take advantage of my most productive hours In fact, I’m writing this very line at my makeshift new workspace at 7.50AM.
