		<h1>I, Reboot</h1>
		<p>Fear is probably the greatest demotivator that exists. Nothing stops you from doing things like fear. And by fear, I mean fear of loss. All fear is fear of loss.</p>
		<p>Are you afraid of heights? You’re really afraid of falling. Which, in turn, is a fear of loss of life or loss of health. What you really fear is dying or being badly hurt.</p>
		<p>Are you afraid of taking a financial risk? What you're really afraid of is losing money.</p>
		<p>Afraid of taking a social risk? You’re really afraid of losing your reputation.</p>
		<p>And so on.</p>
		<p>All fear is fear of loss. And nothing paralyses like fear.</p>
		<p>Is it any wonder that those who have the least to lose are often the ones who take the biggest risks and end up achieving the most?</p>
		<p>And the more you have to lose, the harder it gets. Or, more accurately, the more <em>you think</em> you have to lose, the harder it gets. The more attached you are to the things you have, the harder you will find it to take risks.</p>
		<p>That’s why I’m breaking things. And this is a chronicle of that process.</p>
		<p>I’m starting by letting go of some of the things that I’ve accumulated. Things don’t make me happy and mostly just get in the way. In the process, I hope to remove some of the fear, clear some of the roadblocks, and make myself some room to play.</p>
