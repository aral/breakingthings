		<h1>Breaking Things</h1>

		<figure><img src="/images/posts/breaking-things/aralbalkan.com.jpg" alt="The design of my old personal site"><figcaption>I didn’t have much love for my old site.</figcaption></figure>

		<p>I hate my personal site. Although it car&shy;ries my name, it says next to no&shy;th&shy;ing about who I am today.</p>

		<p>I hate how it looks. I hate how it behaves. I hate that it’s a blog. I hate that it runs on Wordpress. I hate that it forces me to deal with PHP and MySQL. I hate that it’s still host&shy;ed on the same hosting account that I’ve had for over ten years, that I’m paying way too much for, and that dutifully crashes on cue whenever there’s any spike in traffic. I hate that I have to stare at the butt‐ugly sewer beast of a site administration panel that is CPanel…</p>

		<p>Yes, I believe it can be said with some level of certainty that I’m really not too fond of my personal site.</p>


		<p>The worst thing is, I’ve known about this for quite some time now. And, instead of do&shy;ing something about it when I first realised it, I started ignoring the problem. I’m too busy, you see (but not too busy to watch all four seasons of Merlin, followed by both seasons of Legend of the Seeker<a id="footnote-origin" href="#footnote"><sup>*</sup></a>). The cobbler’s children have no shoes, you must under&shy;stand… Pick a whiny ex&shy;cuse of the hour and I’ll recite it back to you with all the confidence and charm of a man in denial who hates his site.</p>

		<blockquote>Sometimes, you need to break things before you can fix them.</blockquote>

		<p>The longer I left the site, the more a&shy;shamed of it I got. And the more a&shy;shamed of it I got, the harder I ignored it. It was a vicious cycle that meant that before long, I stopped blogging com&shy;plete&shy;ly. Al&shy;most imme&shy;diate&shy;ly, I start&shy;ed to feel the ache of my unfulfilled desire to write in my very bones. And my followers be&shy;gan to feel the pain in their timelines as I vented my unblogged frustrations in a staccato of bite‐sized squeaks on Twitter. But Twitter is no substitute for a good, meaty, long‐form rant that you can really sink your teeth into.</p>

		<p>Breaking Things has allowed me the freedom to write again without being ashamed of where my words are being read. However, it’s time to stop ignoring the ele&shy;phant in the room: I need to do some&shy;thing about my per&shy;sonal site. So, today, I took some action. I broke it.</p>

		<h2>Picking up the pieces</h2>

		<p>If you visit <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/" title="Aral Balkan &amp;middot; Passionate geekisms.">the site that carries my name</a> today, you will see a very basic page that has my ugly mug, bio, and contact details. It took me about an hour to put together and I already like it better than what was there before. The blog posts from my over a de&shy;cade of blogging are still there but not linked to from the main page. Don’t worry, I have no intention of breaking the web; I’ll export static versions of the posts before I move away from Wordpress and my old host and issue permanent re&shy;directs so all existing links will still work.</p>

		<p>Breaking the site was the first step.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, you need to break things before you can fix them.</p>
